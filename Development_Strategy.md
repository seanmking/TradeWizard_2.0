## 1. Executive Summary

TradeWizard is an AI-powered platform designed to help South African SMEs successfully navigate international exports. This document outlines our development strategy for TradeWizard 2.0, focusing on building a robust MVP that addresses the core challenges faced by SMEs:

- Complex export compliance and certification requirements
- Lack of market intelligence and export opportunities
- Overwhelming logistics and operational challenges

The project will use a hybrid architecture approach that maintains clear separation between components while optimizing for development speed and quality.

This strategy emphasizes a methodical review and integration of valuable code from the original TradeWizard codebase (available in the entrepreneur's GitHub repository) to avoid duplication of effort and leverage previously developed functionality.

## 2. Project Vision & Goals

### 2.1 Core Problem Statement

98% of African SMEs fail in their first export attempt, not due to product quality but because of trade complexity, documentation challenges, and lack of guidance. This represents a **$2.5B annual opportunity in lost export revenue**.

### 2.2 Vision

TradeWizard aims to transform how African businesses go global by:

- Making complex export processes manageable
- Automating documentation and compliance
- Providing expert validation
- Connecting verified buyers and sellers
- Offering working capital solutions

### 2.3 MVP Goals

The MVP will focus on three core areas:

#### 1. Export Readiness Assessment

- AI-driven analysis of SME capabilities
- Personalized roadmap for export readiness
- Progress tracking and milestone achievements

#### 2. Market Intelligence

- Regulatory requirements for target markets (UAE, USA, UK)
- Market demand assessment for specific product categories
- Basic competitive intelligence

#### 3. User Experience

- Modern, intuitive interface that resembles familiar platforms
- Clear visualization of progress and requirements
- Conversational AI guidance throughout the process

## 3. Architecture Strategy

### 3.1 Hybrid Architecture Approach

We will implement a hybrid architecture that maintains the three-layer design while optimizing for MVP development:

#### 1. AI Agent Layer

- Handles user interactions and conversation management
- Processes data from MCPs to generate insights and recommendations
- Updates user progress and manages export readiness scoring

#### 2. MCP Layer (Middleware Component Providers)

- **Compliance MCP:** Handles regulatory requirements and certification data
- **Market Intelligence MCP:** Manages trade flow data and market opportunities
- **Export Logistics MCP:** Placeholder implementation for future functionality

#### 3. Database Layer

- Manages user profiles, progress tracking, and assessment data
- Stores cached regulatory and market intelligence
- Handles authentication and security

### 3.2 Implementation Approach

- **Separate Codebases:** Each MCP will have a separate codebase to maintain clear boundaries and responsibilities
- **Simplified Deployment:** Initially package components together for faster development and debugging
- **Well-Defined Interfaces:** Establish clear API contracts between components
- **Future Expansion:** Structure code to allow extraction into true microservices when ready to scale

### 3.3 Project Structure Clarification

The TradeWizard 2.0 project follows a monorepo approach for the MVP stage, with the following structure:

```
tradewizard_2.0/
├── frontend/              # Next.js application (not a git submodule)
│   ├── app/               # App router directories
│   ├── components/        # UI components
│   └── public/            # Static assets
│
├── backend/               # Express.js server
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── api/           # API routes and controllers
│   │   ├── services/      # Business logic
│   │   └── mcp/           # Middleware Component Providers
│
├── lib/                   # Shared utilities and types
└── app/                   # Root application configuration
```

**Important Notes:**
- All components exist within a single repository
- No git submodules should be used in this project
- Future versions may extract MCPs into separate repositories, but during MVP development, everything remains in one codebase
- The Next.js application and Express backend are part of the same monorepo, not separate repositories

## 5. Development Principles

### 5.1 Code Quality Standards

- **Modularity:** Components should have single responsibilities
- **Reusability:** Common functionality should be abstracted into reusable utilities
- **Readability:** Code should be self-documenting with clear naming conventions
- **Consistency:** Follow established patterns throughout the codebase
- **Testing:** Critical paths should have automated tests

### 5.2 UI/UX Principles

- **Familiar Patterns:** Use interaction models from popular apps (WhatsApp for chat, Slack/Trello for workflows)
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Present information in digestible chunks
- **Mobile-First:** Design for mobile experiences first, then enhance for larger screens

### 5.3 AI Interaction Design

- **Conversational:** Natural dialogue with clear, concise responses
- **Contextual:** Maintain conversation context across sessions
- **Helpful:** Proactively suggest next steps and solutions
