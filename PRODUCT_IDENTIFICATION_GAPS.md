   - Document technical constraints
   - Identify stakeholder needs

3. **Implementation Planning**:
   - Create detailed implementation plans
   - Define milestones and deliverables
   - Identify resource requirements
   - Establish timeline

4. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Define testing requirements
   - Create validation criteria
   - Establish quality metrics
   - Plan user acceptance testing
