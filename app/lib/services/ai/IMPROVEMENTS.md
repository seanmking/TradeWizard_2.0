# Hybrid Model Selector Improvements

This document details the improvements made to the TradeWizard 2.0 hybrid model selector implementation based on the code review recommendations.

## 1. Directory Structure Consolidation

We've consolidated the hybrid model selector implementation to establish a single source of truth in `app/lib/services/ai`. The duplicate implementation in `src/ai-agent/services` has been replaced with references to the canonical implementation. This ensures consistent behavior and simplifies maintenance.

### Key Files:
- `app/lib/services/ai/model-selector.ts` - The canonical model selector implementation
- `app/lib/services/ai/openai-service.ts` - Enhanced OpenAI service
- `app/lib/services/ai/cost-monitoring.ts` - New cost monitoring service
- `app/lib/services/ai/utils/` - Directory for utility classes

## 2. Enhanced Error Handling

We've significantly improved error handling in the OpenAI service:

### Key Improvements:
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implemented an exponential backoff strategy to handle transient failures
- **Custom Error Types**: Added specific error classes for better error categorization:
  - `OpenAIServiceError` - Base class for all errors
  - `OpenAIRateLimitError` - Specifically for rate limiting errors
  - `OpenAITimeoutError` - For timeout issues
- **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback to GPT-3.5-Turbo when GPT-4 is unavailable
- **Configurable Timeouts**: Added timeout settings to prevent long-running requests

## 3. Cost Monitoring Integration

A new comprehensive cost monitoring system has been implemented:

### Key Features:
- **Usage Tracking**: Records token usage, response times, and estimated costs for each API call
- **Model Analytics**: Provides insights into model usage patterns and performance
- **Cost Estimation**: Calculates costs based on current OpenAI pricing
- **Filtering & Reporting**: Supports filtering by date ranges and users
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks average response times by model

### Integration Points:
- The system is integrated with the OpenAI service to automatically track all API calls
- User IDs are passed through for attribution
- Cached responses are also tracked to measure cost savings

## 4. Performance Optimization

Several performance improvements have been implemented:

### Key Optimizations:
- **Query Caching**: Added a TTL-based cache for similar queries to reduce API calls
- **Optimized Term Detection**: Improved the complexity detection algorithm for better performance with long queries
- **Efficient Iteration**: Updated collection operations to use more efficient patterns
- **Message Pruning**: Enhanced the conversation message pruning to reduce token usage
- **Early Termination**: Added early exit conditions in loops to avoid unnecessary processing

## 5. Additional Utilities

New utility classes have been added to support the core improvements:

### Key Utilities:
- **ExponentialBackoff**: Implements a configurable backoff strategy for retries
- **QueryCache**: Generic TTL-based cache with memory management
- **Token Estimation**: Utility for estimating token count from text

## 6. Testing

Comprehensive unit tests have been added for the new components:

### Test Coverage:
- **Cost Monitoring**: Tests for usage recording, statistics gathering, and cost calculation
- **Query Cache**: Tests for caching behavior, TTL enforcement, and memory management
- **Model Selection**: Tests for complexity detection and model selection logic

## Recent Improvements

### Simplified Model Selection (Latest)

We've improved the model selection approach to be more cost-effective and user-friendly:

- **Default to GPT-3.5-Turbo**: Most tasks now use GPT-3.5-Turbo by default, which provides:
  - Faster response times (better UX)
  - Lower costs (3-10x cheaper than GPT-4)
  - Consistent experience for simpler queries

- **GPT-4 for Complex Analysis Only**: We now reserve GPT-4 for:
  - Website analysis
  - Summary generation
  - Extremely complex queries

This change improves user experience by providing more consistent response times while significantly reducing costs.

### Testing and Validation

A test script has been added (`test-gpt35-default.ts`) to validate the model selection logic and ensure it's working as expected.

## Usage Examples

### Model Selection

```typescript
import { selectModelForTask } from './ai';
import { TaskType } from './ai/types';

// Select the appropriate model based on task complexity
const model = selectModelForTask(
  'website_analysis' as TaskType,
  'Please analyze our website at https://example.com',
  true // hasStructuredData
);
```

### Cost Monitoring

```typescript
import { costMonitoringService } from './ai';

// Get usage statistics for a specific time period
const startDate = new Date('2023-01-01');
const endDate = new Date('2023-01-31');
const stats = costMonitoringService.getUsageStats(startDate, endDate);

console.log(`Total tokens used: ${stats.totalTokens}`);
console.log(`Total cost: $${stats.totalCost.toFixed(4)}`);
```

### Error Handling with Retry

```typescript
import { openAIService, OpenAIRateLimitError } from './ai';

try {
  const response = await openAIService.getCompletion(
    messages,
    { timeoutMs: 20000 }, // 20 second timeout
    'summary',
    false,
    'user123'
  );
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof OpenAIRateLimitError) {
    console.log('Rate limited by OpenAI, please try again later');
  } else {
    console.error('Failed to get completion:', error);
  }
}
```

## Future Considerations

- **Database Integration**: Store usage statistics in a database for long-term analytics
- **User Quotas**: Implement user-specific usage limits
- **Cost Alerts**: Add alerting for unusual usage patterns or when nearing budget thresholds
- **Model Performance Analysis**: Track model quality metrics to optimize the selection strategy
- **A/B Testing**: Set up infrastructure to test different model selection strategies
