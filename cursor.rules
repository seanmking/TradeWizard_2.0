# TradeWizard 2.0 Development Guidelines

## Project Execution Conventions

### ALWAYS CHECK start.sh FIRST
Before running any scripts or services, review the `start.sh` file to understand:
- How services are started and in what order
- What environment variables are required
- Which directory to run commands from
- How test modes are invoked
- Any special protocols or parameters needed

### Running Services and Tests

1. **Directory Context Matters**:
   - Most scripts must be run from their respective directories (e.g., backend scripts from the `/backend` directory)
   - Check `start.sh` to confirm the correct working directory for each command

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use `TEST_MODE=true` when running test scripts
   - Set proper PORT values as defined in start.sh
   - Example: `cd backend && TEST_MODE=true PORT=5005 npm run test:compliance-simple`

3. **Script Naming Conventions**:
   - Test scripts: `test:{component-name}`
   - Development servers: `dev`
   - Production builds: `build`

## Code Style & Organization

1. **TypeScript Safety**:
   - Always handle null checking properly
   - Use non-null assertions (!) only when you're absolutely certain
   - Add explicit type checking for mock data

2. **MCP Structure**:
   - Follow Model-Controller-Protocol pattern
   - Keep models in `models/` directory
   - Keep controllers in `controllers/` directory
   - Keep services in `services/` directory

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Use consistent error response format
   - Always include status code and meaningful message
   - Log errors in development mode

## Documentation

1. **README Files**:
   - Each MCP should have its own README.md
   - Document API endpoints, data structures, and usage examples

2. **Comments**:
   - Document complex logic with clear comments
   - Add JSDoc comments for public functions and interfaces

## Testing & Deployment

1. **Test Mode**:
   - Use mock data in test mode for reliable unit tests
   - Set `TEST_MODE=true` environment variable for testing

2. **Cache Management**:
   - Be aware of caching behavior in development vs production
   - Use debug endpoints to clear cache when needed

## REMINDER
Always run scripts according to the conventions in the project's start.sh file.
When in doubt, run: `./start.sh test [test-type]` to use the project's standardized test runner.
