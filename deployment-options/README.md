# Deployment Options for TradeWizard 2.0

This directory contains alternative deployment configurations for TradeWizard 2.0 that may be useful for future scaling.

## Contents

- **Kubernetes** - A complete Kubernetes deployment architecture for large-scale, production-grade deployment
  - Includes detailed configurations for multi-environment deployments (dev, staging, production)
  - Designed for high availability, scalability, and maintainability
  - Appropriate when the application needs to scale to handle significant traffic

## Current Deployment Approach

For the current phase of development, we're using a simpler deployment approach:

- **Frontend**: Deployed via Vercel (configuration in the project root's `vercel.json`)
- **Backend Services**: Deployed via Railway (managed through their dashboard or minimal configuration)

This simpler approach provides:
- Faster deployment cycles
- Lower maintenance overhead
- Reduced infrastructure costs
- Minimal DevOps expertise required

As the application grows, the more robust Kubernetes configuration in this directory
can be revisited to support larger scale operations.
